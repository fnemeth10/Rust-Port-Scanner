# Rust-Port-Scanner
This Rust code is a simple port scanner. It takes in two optional command-line arguments: the minimum and maximum ports to scan. The program will scan all the ports from min_port to max_port and determine if they are open or closed. If a port is open, it will be displayed as "Port X is open". If a port is closed, it will be counted as a closed port. At the end of the scan, the number of open and closed ports will be displayed.
